## Introduction

This paper introduces [UniSAr](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.07781.pdf), which extends existing autoregressive language models to incorporate three non-invasive extensions to make them structure-aware:
(1) adding structure mark to encode database schema, conversation context, and their relationships; 
 (2) constrained decoding to decode well structured SQL for a given database schema; and 
 (3) SQL completion to complete potential missing JOIN relationships in SQL based on database schema. 

[//]: # (On seven well-known text-to-SQL datasets covering multi-domain, multi-table and multi-turn, UniSAr demonstrates highly comparable or better performance to the most advanced specifically-designed text-to-SQL models.)

## Dataset and Model
[Spider](https://github.com/taoyds/spider) -> `./data/spider`

[Fine-tuned BART model](https://huggingface.co/dreamerdeo/mark-bart/tree/main)  -> `./models/spider_sl`
(Please download this model by `git-lfs` to avoid the [issue](https://github.com/DreamerDeo/UniSAr_text2sql/issues/1).)

[BookSQL - Coming Soon](#)

```angular2html
sudo apt-get install git-lfs
git lfs install
git clone https://huggingface.co/dreamerdeo/mark-bart
```


## Main dependencies
* Python version >= 3.6
* PyTorch version >= 1.5.0
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* fairseq is going though changing without backward compatibility. Install `fairseq` from source and use [this](https://github.com/nicola-decao/fairseq/tree/fixing_prefix_allowed_tokens_fn) commit for reproducibilty. See [here](https://github.com/pytorch/fairseq/pull/3276) for the current PR that should fix `fairseq/master`.


## Evaluation Pipeline
Step 1: Preprocess via adding schema-linking and value-linking tag.

`python step1_schema_linking.py`

Step 2: Building the input and output for BART.

`python step2_serialization.py`

Step 3: Train T5-Large model 

## Results
**On BookSQL**
| Model | EM | EX | PCM-F1 | BLEU-4 | ROUGE-L 
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Unisar | 43.0% | 47.6 | 0.78 | 0.72 | 0.80
